Thank you for very visiting my homepage. I am a Senior Engineer in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning team, Bellevue, Washington, USA. I work at various stages of Machine learning pipelines with focus on Feature extraction, selection, synthesis.

I was a Senior Software Engineer in the Converstion Engineering group where I worked on core components of Cortana and Cortana development kit. We used to leverage novel Machine Learning techniques to model human conversations and power Cortana to perform tasks for us. Earlier,  I worked with Microsoft Bing team, Hyderabad where I was part of the relevance team building novel Machine learning techniques to improve relevance of Bing search results.

I have graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB)](http://www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai at the department of computer science and engineering. I am fortunate to have been guided by [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen). I worked on the project [Curating and Searching the Annotated Web](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/doc/CSAW/). Part of my thesis was presented as the paper [Compressed Data structures for Annotated Web Search](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/doc/www2012/Cads.pdf) in the [WWW conference 2012, Lyon, France](http://www2012.wwwconference.org/) main track.

Before joining IITB, I worked with Microsoft as part of the APEX Program from Jul'09 - Jun'10.

I worked on a range of topics from assembly language programming to user interface design.

I graduated from the [Computer science department of National Institute of Technology, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in/department/cse/) in 2009 with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
